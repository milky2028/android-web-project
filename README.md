# android-web-project
This is a webpage that I wholly created from my Android phone. Why did I do this? I'm not 100% sure, but I did it nonetheless.

I think this will probably end up as my portfolio site, but who knows. I'm trying to imagine a use case for this. I'll probably write out many of the advantages/disadvantages.

How was this achieved?
*The big one is Termux. Termux is a Linux enviornment enulator for Android. From there, many of the tools used in typical NodeJS development are available.
